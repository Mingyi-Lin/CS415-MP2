  Instead of starting with the layout of my level at the beginning of the MP, I started by creating and adjusting the functionalities of my enemy. I logic is that I have to first figure out what my enemies would do before I set up the details of my level. My level is a parkour-like linear level in which the player must reach the final goal of the level(signified by a glowing pickup). 
	At spawn, the player will be shown the basic pick-ups of the level: the health-pack and points collectibles, and is shown how to eliminate enemy. After the tutorial, I put 2 pursuer enemy at the gate of my level to challenge the player. Also, I built a secret door on the side of the castle with points pickups to encourage the player to explore the map. Then, there will be multiple static enemy that constantly shoots projectiles to the player character. I made the turret-like enemy in order to “threaten” the player by not only melee damages, but also range damages. Then , I set the mortar enemy at the top of the castle. This way, the mortar is able to shoot the player at any point of the map, driving the player to explore the level non-stop. Lastly, I set up a pursuer and a turret enemy as the last part of the level. The player will succeed when they collect the final collectible. 
	
	All of the aforementioned enemy will be destructible via colliding with their icon on the top of their head and will add points to the player so as to encourage the player to interact more with the enemy on their way to pursue a better score. 

	The level is generally short and not challenging. The damage of the mortar projectile and different collision are low. However, the player must still sharpen their movement skills in order to pursue a better score.
